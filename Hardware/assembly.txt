Assembling the device was pretty straightforward. Using sticky pads along the bottom, place the Teensy near one corner so that it sits mostly flush on the USB face to one wall. Mark this, then cut a hole slightly larger than the USB fitting for that to fit through. On the opposite side of the case, use a drill to make a hole that fits your switch (ours was about 5/8"). I recommend using progressively larger drill bits to make for a smooth hole. Then use a dremel to do any final size adjustments needed and attach your switch. (We used one that self-anchored. If not using one like that, you'll likely need hot glue or something, which probably won't hold up as well)
Beyond that, the RTC and bluetooth modules should be able to anchor to the bottom of the case with room to spare, and there should be sufficient room for the cables and LED to run around inside.
That's it. Highly recommend sticky pads to keep things in place, and hot-glue on the teensy to keep it from moving when being plugged/unplugged.
