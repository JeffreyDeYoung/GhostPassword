Parts needed:
1 - Teensy 2.0 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/12765)
  * Estimated cost: $18
  * We used an LC originally, but the EEPROM was very small. That might work, and probably a 2.0++ or 3
  However, the pin layout had to change for the LC, and I assume would have to for anything but the 2.0
1 - BlueSmirf (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12577 or https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10938)
  * Estimated cost: $25
  * We used the HID, which required changing a setting to make it not an HID device. The silver is probably a better choice
1 - DS3231 RTC (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HCB7VYS)
  * Estimated cost: $4
  * This unit was somewhat large, and could likely be replaced by a smaller unit. However: Do not use
  a DS1307 chipset. The DS1307's are sensitive to pressure/temperature and lose time rapidly. The DS3231 is far more reliable
1 - NeoPixel LED (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1612)
  * Estimated cost: $4
  * Optional. Useful for status, and generally fun to use
1 - Momentary switch
  * Estimated cost: $1
  * We picked up some random switches till we found one that fit.
  * There are two types, a four-pin momentary, and a toggle (2 pin). Circuit layout varies for them.
1 - Case (http://www.containerstore.com/s/hinged-boxes/d?productId=10032173)
  * Estimated cost: $2
  * We used a medium hinged box, but anything that fits it all will work
  * This took a lot of trial and error on box size
1 set - Right angle headers (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553)
  * Estimated cost: $1
  * We soldered these on ourselves.
  * The pinout side (0-8) was soldered out away from the board
  * The power pin was soldered so that it extended over the other pin holes
  * You could do this however you prefer, but to keep it low profile, we recommend the right-angles
A bunch - Jumper wires (http://www.amazon.com/Veewon-Flexible-Multicolored-Female-Breadboard/dp/B00N7XXJG4)
  * Estimated cost: $1
  * We used 10cm ones to reduce the amount of cabling inside the box.
  * You could solder everything, but good luck with that. Jumper cables worked great.


Total cost estimate: $55

If you were to eliminate the OTP functionality and the LED, you could get costs down to $46, but it would kinda eliminate half the functionality.
